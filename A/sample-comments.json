{"author":"Adezar","body":"When the Tea Party took over they boosted the \"Conservative Values\" part of the conservative movement, which included a lot of religious people, unfortunately the very fervent religious people (Evangelicals)... they are prone to follow people (which is poetic since their Bible says not to do that).

That is how they refuse to admit Trump is not at all like a Christian.\n\nThere ARE intelligent conservatives, but they are kind of stuck without a home, but honestly that old version of conservatism where the Government shouldn't be involved is probably impossible with how the world is changing.
